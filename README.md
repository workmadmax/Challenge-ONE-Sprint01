<h3>About</h3>
<p><i>This is an application that encrypts texts, so the user can exchange secret messages with other people who know the encryption secret used</i></p>

### The encryption "keys" we will be usiing are: <br>

`The letter "e" is converted to "enter"`<br>
`The letter "i" is aconvertd to "imes"`<br>
`The letter "a" is converted to "ai"`<br>
`The letter "o" is converted to "ober"`<br>
`The letter "u" is converted to "ufat"`<br>


### Requirements: <br>

- It must only work with lowercase letters
- No accented letters or special characters should be used
- It must be possible to convert a word to its encrypted version and also to return an encrypted to the original version.


### My Concluded

- CSS is amazing but quite laborious. Congratz to those who main it.
